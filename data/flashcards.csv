maximum_likelihood,What is the principle of maximum likelihood in statistics?,"It is a method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model by maximizing the likelihood function, which measures how well the model explains the observed data.",
independent_random_variables,What does it mean for two random variables to be independent?,It means that the occurrence of one random variable does not affect the probability distribution of the other.,
markov_chains,What is a Markov chain?,A Markov chain is a stochastic process where the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.,
convex_sets,What is a convex set in mathematics?,"A set is convex if, for any two points within the set, the line segment connecting them is also entirely contained within the set.",
convex_optimization,What is convex optimization?,Convex optimization is a subfield of optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets.,
random_variables,What is a random variable in probability theory?,"A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon, which can take on different values based on the outcome of a random process.",
positive_definite_matrices,What is a positive definite matrix?,"A positive definite matrix is a symmetric matrix where all its eigenvalues are positive, meaning for any non-zero vector x, the quadratic form x^T A x is greater than zero.",
functions_of_several_variables,What is a function of several variables?,"A function of several variables is a mathematical function that takes multiple input variables and produces a single output, often represented as f(x, y, z, ...) where x, y, z are the input variables.",
